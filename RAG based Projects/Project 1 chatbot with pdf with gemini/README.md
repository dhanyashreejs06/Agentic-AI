This code implements a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using Streamlit, LangChain, and Gemini Pro. Here’s a breakdown of what each part does:

Imports & Setup

Loads required libraries for Streamlit UI, PDF loading, text splitting, embeddings, vector storage, LLM, and prompt templates.
Loads environment variables (for API keys, etc.) using dotenv.
Streamlit UI

Sets the app title: "RAG Application using Gemini Pro".
Document Loading & Processing

Loads a PDF file (my_paper.pdf) using PyPDFLoader.
Splits the PDF into manageable text chunks (size 1000 characters) for processing.
Vector Store & Retriever

Embeds the document chunks using Google’s embedding model.
Stores embeddings in a Chroma vector database.
Sets up a retriever to fetch the top 10 most similar chunks for any query.
LLM Setup

Initializes Gemini Pro as the language model.
Prompt & Chain Construction

Waits for user input via a chat box.
Defines a system prompt instructing the LLM to answer using retrieved context, concisely.
Builds a prompt template for the LLM.
If the user submits a query:
Creates a chain that retrieves relevant context and generates an answer.
Invokes the chain with the user’s input.
Prints and displays the answer in the Streamlit app.
Summary:
The app lets users ask questions about the content of a PDF. It retrieves relevant sections from the PDF, feeds them to Gemini Pro, and returns concise answers.


Step 1: Created Virtual env for main folder usng conda create -n gitprojects python=3.12

step 2 : to clear terminal zsh : command is zsh

step 3: Get gemini api key

How to Add and Push New Subfolders in the Future
Whenever you add a new folder (project) anywhere inside your main Agentic AI Projects folder, follow these steps:

1. Add your new files/folders
Just create them as usual in Finder or using mkdir/touch commands.

2. Stage the changes
From the root of your main project folder (Agentic AI Projects):

This will stage all new and changed files/folders, including any new subfolders.

3. Commit the changes
Replace <your-folder-name> with the actual name or a description.

4. Push to GitHub
Example: Add a New Project
Suppose you want to add a new folder called Project 2 chatbot inside RAG based Projects:

Key Points
Never initialize a new git repo inside a subfolder of your main repo.
Always run git add . from the root of your main project to include all changes.
Use git status to see what will be committed.
Use clear commit messages.
Summary:
Just create new folders and files as needed, then always use git add ., git commit -m "message", and git push from your main project root. This will keep your GitHub repo up to date with all subfolders and files.
